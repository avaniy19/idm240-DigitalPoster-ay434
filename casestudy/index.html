          <h2 id="first"> Overview:</h2>
          <p>In this project, I used my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JS techniques to create a responsive and scalable graphic poster with interactive elements and engaging animations.
              I focused on transforming and styling vector graphics, raster graphics, and text while considering dynamic design. 
              The project resulted in dynamic graphics that respond to user interaction and adapt to changing device sizes.
              This course equipped me with the skills and knowledge required to keep confidently creating graphic responsive designs.

          <h2 id="second"> Context & Challenge:</h2>
          <p>This project aimed to combine my knowledge of aesthetics and visual design with the manipulation of SVGs and responsive techniques. I had some prior experience with SVGs, which are crucial for creating responsive designs that maintain their quality when scaled up or down. However, I had never directly styled and transformed vector graphics before. Using basic motion-interactive principles, I created a poster promoting one of my favorite artistâ€™s (Amy Winehouse) first appearance at UK's Glastonbury Festival in 2004. I decided to do a modern twist on this piece of promotional material, and also drew inspiration from my favorite music streaming platform, Spotify.
          </p>
          <h2 id="third"> Process & Insight:</h2>
          <p>Each week of iterating brought entirely new ideas, and I found myself straying farther and father from my original design ideas and mock ups. However, upon reflection, I am grateful for the rounds of trial and error that ultimately led me back to a design that was inspired by Spotify's web player. I was eager to convey the high-energy atmosphere of the Glastonbury Festival, so I incorporated an upbeat looping animation to captivate the user's attention. Drawing inspiration from professional music festival photography, I was able to come up with a unique design that not only caught the user's eye but also echoed the familiarity of Spotify's user interface.</p>
          <div class="image-container">
            <img src="images/amy.jpeg" alt="Image 1">
            <img src="images/image1.png" alt="Image 2">
            <img src="images/background.jpg" alt="Image 3">
          </div>
          
          <h2 id="fourth"> Solution:</h2>
          <p>My design features a lively looping animation of festival-goers that immediately sets the fun and energetic tone for the poster. To further tie the design to Spotify's interface, I incorporated the unique button-style, complete with padding and rounded edges. In order to ensure a cohesive look, I went the extra mile to source the exact font used in the Spotify interface. The color scheme was an opportunity for me to showcase Amy's powerful and feminine energy, as well as capture the vibrant nature of the festival. This design is truly one-of-a-kind, as it blends the nostalgic energy of youth with the sleek and modern UI of a beloved platform.</p>
          <h2 id="fifth"> Results:</h2>
          <p>Overall, I consider the project to be a success. The primary objective was to combine knowledge of aesthetics and visual design with manipulation of SVGs and responsive techniques to create a unique poster for Amy Winehouse's appearance at Glastonbury Festival. Through the iterations and experimentation process, I was able to successfully create a design that captured the high-energy atmosphere of the festival while also drawing upon the familiarity of Spotify's interface.

              Lessons learned from this project include the importance of iterative design processes, allowing oneself to stray from original ideas and mockups, and the significance of paying attention to small details like font and color scheme to ensure a cohesive and polished design.
