          <h2>The Overview</h2>
          <p>In this project, I used my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JS techniques to create a responsive and scalable graphic poster with interactive elements and engaging animations.
              I focused on transforming and styling vector graphics, raster graphics, and text while considering dynamic design. 
              The project resulted in visually stunning and dynamic graphics that respond to user interaction and adapt to changing device sizes, considering user engagement and delight.
              This course equipped me with the skills and knowledge required to create modern graphic designs and animations.
